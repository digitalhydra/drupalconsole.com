Drupal Console 1.6.1 is out. The latest release contains bug fixes. Also no longer required dependencies removed from the project and development dependencies added as suggested packages.

#### Required Changes

If using `.env` files, the `vlucas/phpdotenv` dependency must be installed manually using composer.

```bash
composer require&nbsp;vlucas/phpdotenv --dev
```
